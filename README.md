# overview 
This project conducts an EDA on financial datasets obtained from SEC filings. The Dataset comprises numerical data, textual data, submission information and tagged data extracted from SEC filings, covering various aspects of the companys's financial performance, compliance and disclosures
# Aim

## Components:
The dataset consists of the following files:
Numerical data files('num')
Textual data files('pre')
Submission Data files('sub')
Tagged Data files('tag')

# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
## Loading Dataset 
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
## EDA on Num Files
- Gain insights into the numerical data in the 'num' files, including distribution, central tendency and outliers 
- Visualize the average value over time and identify outliers using IQR method
- Analyze quarterly variation and trends in revenue, net income, EPS, Profit margings and ROE
## EDA on SUB files
- Identify seasonal patterns in the number of submissions and analyze submission trends over time.
## EDA on TAG files
- Visualize the distribution of custom and abstract tags and explore correlations between numerical attributes
## Analysis of Filing Types
- Analyze the frequency distribution of different filing types ('form') to understand the type of disclosures made by the company.
## Findings and Insights
- Financial Performance: Revenue and net income have shown steady growth, while EPS has fluctuated slightly. Profit margins have remained stable over time.
- Liquidity and Solvency: Current and quick ratios indicate healthy liquidity levels, with adequate cash to meet short-term obligations.
- Operational Efficiency: Inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover have improved, contributing to higher ROA and ROE.
